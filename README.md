## üïå Framework
<b>UFO</b> <img src="./assets/ufo_blue.png" alt="UFO Image" width="24"> operates as a dual-agent framework, encompassing:
- <b>AppAgent ü§ñ</b>, tasked with choosing an application for fulfilling user requests. This agent may also switch to a different application when a request spans multiple applications, and the task is partially completed in the preceding application. 
- <b>ActAgent üëæ</b>, responsible for iteratively executing actions on the selected applications until the task is successfully concluded within a specific application. 
- <b>Control Interaction üéÆ</b>, is tasked with translating actions from AppAgent and ActAgent into interactions with the application and its UI controls. It's essential that the targeted controls are compatible with the Windows **UI Automation** API.

Both agents leverage the multi-modal capabilities of GPT-Vision to comprehend the application UI and fulfill the user's request. For more details, please consult our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07939).

## ‚ú® Getting Started


### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Installation
UFO requires **Python >= 3.10** running on **Windows OS >= 10**. It can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
# [optional to create conda environment]
# conda create -n ufo python=3.10
# conda activate ufo

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/UFO.git
cd UFO
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure the LLMs
Before running UFO, you need to provide your LLM configurations. You can configure create a config file `ufo/config/config.yaml` by copying the `ufo/config/config.yaml.template` edited as follows. 

#### OpenAI
```
API_TYPE: "openai" 
OPENAI_API_BASE: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" # The base URL for the OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Set the value to the openai key for the llm model
OPENAI_API_MODEL: "GPTV_MODEL_NAME"  # The only OpenAI model by now that accepts visual input
```

#### Azure OpenAI (AOAI)
```
API_TYPE: "aoai" 
OPENAI_API_BASE: "YOUR_ENDPOINT" # The AOAI API address. Format: https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/chat/completions?api-version={api-version}
OPENAI_API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Set the value to the openai key for the llm model
OPENAI_API_MODEL: "GPTV_MODEL_NAME"  # The only OpenAI model by now that accepts visual input
```


### üéâ Step 3: Start UFO

#### ‚å®Ô∏è You can execute the following on your Windows command Line (CLI):

```bash
# assume you are in the cloned UFO folder
python -m ufo --task <your_task_name>
```

This will start the UFO process and you can interact with it through the command line interface. 
If everything goes well, you will see the following message:

```bash
Welcome to use UFOüõ∏, A UI-focused Agent for Windows OS Interaction. 
 _   _  _____   ___
| | | ||  ___| / _ \
| | | || |_   | | | |
| |_| ||  _|  | |_| |
 \___/ |_|     \___/
Please enter your request to be completedüõ∏:
```
#### ‚ö†Ô∏èReminder:  ####
- Before UFO executing your request, please make sure the targeted applications are active on the system.
- The GPT-V accepts screenshots of your desktop and application GUI as input. Please ensure that no sensitive or confidential information is visible or captured during the execution process. For further information, refer to [DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md).


###  Step 4 üé•: Execution Logs 

You can find the screenshots taken and request & response logs in the following folder:
```
./ufo/logs/<your_task_name>/
```
You may use them to debug, replay, or analyze the agent output.

## üìä Evaluation

Please consult the [WindowsBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07939.pdf) provided in Section A of the Appendix within our technical report. Here are some tips (and requirements) to aid in completing your request:

- Prior to UFO execution of your request, ensure that the targeted application is active (though it may be minimized).
- Occasionally, requests to GPT-V may trigger content safety measures. UFO will attempt to retry regardless, but adjusting the size or scale of the application window may prove helpful. We are actively solving this issue.
- Currently, UFO supports a limited set of applications and UI controls that are compatible with the Windows **UI Automation** API. Our future plans include extending support to the Win32 API to enhance its capabilities.
- Please note that the output of GPT-V may not consistently align with the same request. If unsuccessful with your initial attempt, consider trying again.
